        <p><ul>
          <li>
            MyFridge is an app that keeps track of items in people's refrigerators, or any household food 
            products, in hopes of preventing it from going to waste.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>This app was built using Java, Android Studios, and NotifyMe Library.</li>
          <br>
          <li>
            I spent all of winter break working on this app to sharpen the Android Development skills I 
            learned in Android University and to acquire new skills.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            The inspiration to build this app came from noticing that some of our food products had expired 
            and gone to waste. This made me realize that it would be helpful to have an app to easily track 
            your food products in hopes of saving them from going to waste. I thought about the notification 
            feature so that the person can decide whether the food item can be salvaged or disposed of properly 
            on its expiration date.

        <p id ="title"><b>BookExchange</b><i> (December 2020)</i></p>
        <p><ul>
          <li>BookExchange is an app that allows people to buy, sell, or trade their books and textbooks.</li>
          <br>
          <li>This app was built using Java, Android Studios, Back4App, NYT API, and ISBNdb API.</li>
          <br>
          <li>
            My partners and I worked 2 days per week for around 2 hrs to complete this application as a part of 
            the CodePath Android University program offered in partnership at CSUMB.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            The inspiration to build this app came from our love of reading. As college students, we also 
            realized the need for students having access to affordable books or textbooks, which was what 
            led us to create this app.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Won Best Product Idea at the CSUMB Demo Day!</li>

        <p id ="title"><b>SeeMusic</b><i> (July 2020)</i></p>
        <p><ul>
          <li>
            See Music includes a library of 8 songs that are displayed as colors based on frequency in the 
            form of a bar graph and sounds waves.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>This app was built using JavaScript while implementing the p5.js Library and p5.js Sound Library.</li>
          <br>
          <li>
            My partner and I worked 3 hrs a day for a week to complete this application as a part of Google 
            CSSIx 2020.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            The inspiration to build this app came from a TED Talk video about chromesthesia, which are people 
            who can see music through a spectrum of colors. Because of our astonishment and love of music, me 
            and my partner decided to research this topic and build this app.
